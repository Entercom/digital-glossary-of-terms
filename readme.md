#Glossary of Terms

**Digital Platform** –  A digital platform refers to the software or hardware of a site, however it is much bigger that this simple concept. For example, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are digital platforms.  We are not building just “new websites” – we are building a digital platform, from which many other digital assets and partnerships can be created from, or tie into.  This is a great article that makes the concept of a “platform” less fuzzy.

###Drupal###

Drupal is an open source content management platform powering millions of websites and applications. It’s built, used, and supported by an active and diverse community of people around the world. Drupal is used to build everything from personal blogs to enterprise applications and is the open source software that Entercom has chosen for it’s new Digital Platform.

**Core** - Core refers to the files that make up the default functionality of a Drupal site as downloaded from drupal.org.  The functionality includes menu management, user management, system administration, design and layout, and a taxonomy system to name a few.

**Distribution** -

**Role** - Roles are a grouping of permissions for accessing, creating, editing, and deleting content and managing different aspects of the site.  A role is then assigned to a user and that user has the permissions assigned to the role.  For example, if a role name ‘editor’ is given the ability to create and edit articles and the editor role is assigned to Ellen, the links to create and edit articles are displayed to Ellen when she is logged in. If Ellen sends Joe a link to edit an article and Joe doesn’t have the editor role assigned to his account, he will be shown an “access denied” message.

**Block** - Blocks are a small unit of repetitive pieces of content that get positioned into a region (left sidebar, header, footer, etc.) of a page.  For example, a block containing  company contact information could be added to the footer of all pages.

**Taxonomies** – In Drupal, "Taxonomy" is the name of a powerful core module that gives your sites use of terms. In Drupal, these [terms](https://www.drupal.org/glossary#term) are gathered within [vocabularies](https://www.drupal.org/glossary#vocabulary) which the [Taxonomy module](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/modules/taxonomy) allows you to create, manage and apply.
 
**Themes** – A file or collection of files (PHP, INFO, CSS, JPG, GIF, PNG), which together determine the look and feel of a site. A theme contains elements such as the header, icons, block layout, etc. Drupal modules define [themeable functions](http://api.drupal.org/api/group/themeable) which can be overridden by the theme file. There are additional themes available in the [themes section of downloads](https://www.drupal.org/project/Themes).
 
**Widget** - An application, or a component of an interface, that enables a user to perform a function or access a service.
